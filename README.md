This repo contains the homework sets for the stochastic simulation course, for the team consisting of Lode Vermeulen, Ayman Stitou and Rohith Saai. The code for the first assignment can be found in the folder "Homework 1". There, the most important file is homework1.ipynb, which contains all the code that we used to generate the results in our report. It also contains some .npy files, which store data of large calculations we did that took 3+ hours. The notebook allows the user to run the simulations from scratch, using some standard parameters. In order to be able to reproduce the figures that are seen in the report, the code from the .npy files can be loaded in by uncommenting a block of code in the notebook.
